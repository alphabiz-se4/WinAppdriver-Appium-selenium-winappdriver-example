Try to use jest + appium + winappdriver + webdriverio for UI automation testing, deployed on github actions

Details to note:
1. Download and install winappdriver manually from the command line
2. Open a new command line window to run the appium service
3. Select windows-2022 (the latest version of windows) in actions

This problem has been bothering me for a long time, I have been using windows-latest (windows-2019), so my test application can only get the title, screenshot and maximize the app after opening the app, but cannot find the elements in the app window
